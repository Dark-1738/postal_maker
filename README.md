# Postal Maker
I made this because Im working on a Liberty City server and needed postals, so I decided to try out my "coding" skills and make something of my own. 

Please keep in-mind this is the "first" actual script I made on my own, so feedback would be much appreciated.

## Tutorial
1. Start the script 
2. Once ingame, do ``/pmake add [postal]``
3. After you've collected all your postals do ``/pmake load``
4. Place your new ``postals.json`` in your ``nearest-postal`` resource
5. Change the name of the json in the fxmanifest if needed
6. Your postals are ready for use

## Disclaimer

This script is a dev tool, not just a regular resource.
