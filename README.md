# Postal Maker
I made this because Im working on a Liberty City server and needed postals, so I decided to try out my "coding" skills and make something of my own. 

Please keep in-mind this is the "first" actual script I made on my own, so feedback would be much appreciated. 

[Recommended Nearest Postal Script](https://github.com/DevBlocky/nearest-postal/releases)

## Features
- ``/registerpostal [code]`` - Registers postal at your current coordinates 
- ``/deletepostal [code]`` -  Deletes selected postal from table
- ``/loadpostals`` - Loads all registered postals into a JSON file
- ``/listpostals`` - Prints a list of registered postals
- ``/clearpostals`` - Clears all registered postals

## Tutorial
1. Start the script 
2. Once ingame, do ``/registerpostal``
3. After you've collected all your postals do ``/loadpostals``
4. Place your new ``postals.json`` in your ``nearest-postal`` resource
5. Change the name of the json in the fxmanifest if needed
6. Your postals are ready for use
