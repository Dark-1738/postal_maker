# Postal Maker
I made this because Im working on a Liberty City server and needed postals, so I decided to try out my "coding" skills and make something of my own. 

Please keep in-mind this is my "first" actual script I made on my own, so feedback would be much appreciated. 

[Recommended Nearest Postal Script](https://github.com/DevBlocky/nearest-postal/releases)

## Tutorial
1. Start the script 
2. Once ingame, do ``/addpostal``
3. After you've collected all your postals do ``/loadpostals``
4. Place your new ``postals.json`` in your ``nearest-postal`` resource
5. Change the name of the json in the fxmanifest if needed
6. Your postals are ready for use

## Feature Plans
- [x] Add a way to delete registered postals, like if you make a mistake. (for now you could just restart the script, all data would be lost)
- [x] Add a way to see the currently registered postals table.
- [x] Add a way clear the currently registered postals table. (for now you could just restart the script)
